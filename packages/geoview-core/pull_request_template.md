## What's to look for styling

- Use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions)
- Use PascalCase for type names
- Do not use "I" as a prefix for interface names
- Do not export types/functions unless you need to share it across multiple components
- All names start with a letter
- Always put spaces around operators ( = + - \* / ), and after colon:
- Remove all trailing white spaces
- Look for bad indentation
- Carriage return are mandatory
  - Before comments
  - Before if condition
  - After if condition
  - Before properties
  - Before classes
  - Before functions

The use of Prettier Visual Studio Code extension let's you format automatically your code to remove most of the styling issues like white space and indentation.

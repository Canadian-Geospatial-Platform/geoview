![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/geosearch/searchbar_en.png)

=3!supportedSearchTypes=

### Supported Search Types

**Keyword search**: Type any keyword into geolocator search bar to display a list of results that contains the keyword (minimum 3 characters).

- each search result consists of: location name (with keyword highlighted), location province, and location category (lake, city, town, etc.)
- click on any individual result to mark its coordinates and zoom the map to center around this location

**FSA search**: A **forward sortation area (FSA)** is a way to designate a geographical area based on the first three characters in a Canadian postal code. All postal codes that start with the same three characters are considered an **FSA**.

- click to zoom and center the map on the FSA
- example: type in **M3H**

**Latitude/Longitude search**: Search using lat/long coordinates to display a list of results in the vicinity of that map point.

- similarly to FSA search, the first result will be a location of those coordinates entered, click this to zoom and center the map on the map point
- lat/long search recognizes spaces, commas, semicolons, or vertical bars (|) to separate the co-ordinates
- example: type in **54.3733,-91.7417**

**NTS search**: **National Topographic System (NTS)** is a system used for providing general topographic maps of the country, producing details on landforms, lakes/rivers, forests, roads and railways, etc.

- the NTS is split into three major zones: "Southern zone" - latitudes between 40°N and 68°N, "Arctic zone" - latitudes between 68°N and 80°N, and the "High Arctic zone" - latitudes between 80°N and 88°N
- an NTS map number consists of a string containing a number identifying a map sheet, a letter identifying a map area, and a number identifying the scale map sheet
- likewise, the first result will be a location of the NTS map number, click to center map on this area
- example: type in **030M13**

**Street address**: Search using direct street addresses should return results

=3!geosearchFiltering=

### Geosearch Filtering

When searching for a location, a results panel will appear below the search box. This results panel contains two dropdown boxes that allow you to filter the search results by their **province** and by their **category** (lake, town, river, etc.). To the right of these two boxes is a **Clear Filters** ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/geosearch/clear.svg) button, which when clicked clears the selected filter options.

=2!basemapSelector=

The first two columns of the Data Table are Icon and Zoom. The remaining columns vary depending on the layer selected.

In addition to scrolling data, it is possible to:

- Sort the data by clicking the header of a column with the sort icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/swap_vert_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg).
- Position the map view to the location of the feature corresponding to a given row by selecting the zoom icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/zoom.svg)

Click the action icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/column_action.svg) beside the column header to show the column action dropdown:

- Pin columns to the left ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/pin_left_25.svg) or right ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/pin_right_25.svg) of the table
- Filter the columns by numerical range, text or date (if the configuration allows it). Changes in the table can also be made to reflect on the map by applying or clearing filters from the map (_apply_: ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/filter_toggle_25.svg), _clear_: ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/filter_clear_25.svg))
- Show and/or hide columns by clicking on the _Hide Columns_ icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/column_hide_25.svg)
- Navigate the table using a keyboard

Click on a layer and the number of available features is displayed below the layer title.

### Sorting and Reordering

For each column in the data table, there may be a set of arrows associated with that column which represents how it can be sorted and reordered.

**Column Sort**: Click on the column title to sort the columns in ascending/descending order (for numerical data) and alphabetical order (for text data).

- an upward arrow ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/navigation/up_arrow_20.svg) next to the column title indicates that the column data is being sorted in ascending order or alphabetical order
- a downward arrow ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/navigation/down_arrow_20.svg) next to the column title indicates that the column data is being sorted in descending order or reverse alphabetical order
- no arrow next to the column title means that there is no sort applied to current column

=3!filterData=

### Filter Data

Data can be filtered by column. To show filters, click on the open filters icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/filter_toggle_25.svg). A column is filterable if there is an input field under the title of the header:

![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/filter_open.png)

There are 3 types of filters:

- **Text**: Character input field.
- **Number**: Input fields that accept only numbers
  - If a minimum and a maximum are defined the filter will search for a range
  - If, for example, only a minimum is defined, it will perform the operation _greater than_
- **Date**: Similar to the numeric field but uses dates

Additional filters (varying by column data type) may be found by clicking the action icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/datatable/column_action.svg) beside the column heading, and clicking on **Filter by ...**

=3!keyboardNavigation=

### Keyboard Navigation

Use 'Tab' to go through each of the table controls, and to navigate between the three major table groups:

- Column Headers
- Column Filters
- Table Body

Once any major group is focused on, you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the table cells for that component. Doing this will highlight the currently focused table cell.

To access the buttons and/or input fields within a cell, make sure the cell is highlighted (by using arrow keys as above) and use 'Tab' to navigate between its children.

=2!timeSlider=

### ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/time_slider_30.svg) Time Slider

The Time Slider tab on the Footer Panel has two sections. Layers with a time dimension are listed in the left section. Click on a layer to display its Time Slider in the right section:

The Time Slider section displays a slider bar with one or two draggable handles. A point in time layer will show one handle. A time period layer will show two handles, to adjust the start and end time of the period.

Click hold and drag the handle on the slider bar to set the desired filter values or select a point in time. For a time period layer, click the lock icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/lock_30.svg) to lock the start time handle in place.

Select the filter checkbox ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/layers/check.png) to toggle the filtering on and off.

Click the play icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/play_arrow_30.svg) to animate the filter results through time. Click the change direction icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/direction_arrow_30.svg) to toggle forward or backward in time.

Click the back icon![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/back_arrow_30.svg) or forward icon ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/forward_arrow_30.svg) to progress one step back or forward in time.

Click the time delay dropdown to choose the slider animation time delay. Some layers may require a longer delay time to properly display on the map.

The field being filtered on is displayed in the lower left of the Time Slider section. Custom descriptions may also be displayed in this area.

=2!chart=

### ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/chart_30.svg) Chart

The Chart tab on the Footer Panel has two sections. Layers with a chart are listed in the left section. Select a feature on the map to display its chart in the right section.

_**Note a feature on the map must be selected to enable the layer in the list. Otherwise layers are disabled (greyed out).**_

The Feature dropdown (upper left of the chart section), can be used to select a feature. This is useful when features are close together on the map, making it difficult to click on the desired one.

The visibility of data displayed on the chart can be toggled by clicking the checkbox ![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/layers/check.png) next to the data name shown above the chart (only for layers with multiple data items):

![]({{assetsURL}}/img/guide/footer/checkbox.png)

Select from the Download dropdown (upper right of chart section) to download chart data in JSON format. Select Download All for all data and Download Visible for only data currently visible on the chart.

=3!chartTypes=

### Available Chart Types:

- Line Chart
- Bar Charts
- Pie Charts

Points on line charts can be changed to steps, by selecting from the Steps dropdown in the upper left of the chart section.

Click hold and drag the handles on the the line chart slider bars to change the X or Y axis values displayed for the chart.

=1!issues=

### Load Times / Unanticipated Behaviour

Load times may vary based on:

- network location
- bandwidth availability
- number of layers being loaded
- layer types and their sizes

Unanticipated behaviour may occur if any map interactions occur before data is fully loaded. Please allow the map to load completely before triggering any map functions.

**Note:** If the loading spinner is visible for a layer, please wait for it to disappear before triggering any function on the map.

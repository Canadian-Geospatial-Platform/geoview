The point groupings correspond to the set location that were affected by the same event. The inventory of past flooding has been compiled from various public sources and standardized into a common data model.

Flooding events for which no location was included in the sources are positioned on the place name of the location affected by the flooding.  The event positions do not indicate where the flooding occurred. Flood events that affected more than one locality are represented by a multipoint.\\n\\nIt should be noted that no consultation was conducted with the various providers and stakeholders of historical flood data. Disparities in content between the various sources result in an inconsistent product. No warranty is given as to the accuracy or completeness of the information provided.

/** *****************************************************************************************************************************
 * The AbstractGeoViewRaster class is a direct descendant of AbstractGeoViewLayer. As its name indicates, it is used to
 * instanciate GeoView raster layers. In addition to the components of the parent class, there is an attribute named
 * olLayers where the raster elements of the class will be kept.
 *
 * The olLayers attribute has a hierarchical structure. Its data type is TypeBaseRasterLayer. Subclasses of this type
 * are TypeRasterLayerGroup and TypeRasterLayer. The TypeRasterLayerGroup is a collection of TypetBaseRasterLayer. It is
 * important to note that a TypetBaseRasterLayer attribute can polymorphically refer to a TypeRasterLayerGroup or a
 * TypeRasterLayer. Here, we must not confuse instantiation and declaration of a polymorphic attribute.
 *
 * All leaves of the structure stored in the olLayers attribute must be of type TypeRasterLayer. This is where the
 * features are placed.

# DOC OVERVIEW

The idea for this folder is collect dev-friendly documentation for the moment.

This folder would contain things that answer these types of questions:

- How do I use X?
- What can X do?
- How is X expected to behave?
- What is recommended approach for doing X?

Once the project matures, these docs can be the basis of official public docs, help documentation, etc.

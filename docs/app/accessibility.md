## Accessibility

_Work in progress_

The viewer needs to be accessible for keyboard and screen reader. It's should follow WCAG 2.1 requirements: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21

React and accessibilty documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html

We need to trap the navigation inside the map element: https://mui.com/base-ui/react-focus-trap and add a skip link to go over

Manage focus (Modal Dialogs or any full-screen tasks): https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-focus-on
